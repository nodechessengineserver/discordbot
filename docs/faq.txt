To create an __ACT Discord Server__ atomic tournament use this command with **TestBot** :

     `+t [time inc]`

Example: `+t 3 2`

:triangular_flag_on_post:  *All tournaments will be created in the server owner's name, so please look around and don't create too many redundant tournaments.*

To compare your Atomic rating to an other player, use this command with **TestBot** : 

     `+cmp [lichess user name]`

Example:  `+cmp tipau`

To send a bot message to the <#407793962527752194> channel, use this command with **AtomBot** :

     `+say [message]`

Example:  `+say Hello Atomic World!`

To get the top list of Atomic players, use this command with **TestBot** :

     `+top [num players]`

Example: `+top 3`

To get lichess profile information of a user, use this command with **TestBot** :

     `+p [lichess user name]`

New!   :cyclone:   To verify your username as a lichess member, in the #test channel type:

     `+ver`

You will get a **code** in a __personal message__ that you have to **insert** into your **lichess** profile , then in the #test channel type

     `+check`

Once you are verified, you can remove the code from your profile.

To no longer be listed as a verified lichess member, in the #test channel type:

     `+unver`

Note that you have to have the __exact__ same nick here as on lichess, otherwise verification won't work ( the username check is __case sensitive__ ). If you have a different nick here and want to change it, contact @jatekos#8208.
